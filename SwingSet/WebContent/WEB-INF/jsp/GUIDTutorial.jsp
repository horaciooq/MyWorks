<p>A Globally Unique Identifier or GUID is a special type of identifier used in software applications in order to provide a reference number which is unique in any context (hence, "Globally"), for example, in defining the internal reference for a type of access point in a software application, or for creating unique keys in a database. While each generated GUID is not guaranteed to be unique, the total number of unique keys (2128 or 3.4Ã—1038) is so large that the probability of the same number being generated twice is very small.</p> 
<h4>Generating random GUID using ESAPI</h4>
<p>Following method in the ESAPI's Randomizer interface generates a random GUID.</p>
<p><b>public String getRandomGUID()</b></p>
<p>This method could use a hash of random Strings, the current time, and any other random data available. The format is a well-defined sequence of 32 hex digits grouped into chunks of 8-4-4-4-12.</p>
