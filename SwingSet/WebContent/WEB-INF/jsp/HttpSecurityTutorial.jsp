<h2>Unvalidated Redirects/Forwards</h2>

<p>Web Application Redirects and Forwards are very common and frequently include user
supplied parameters in the destination URL. If they aren't validated, an attacker can 
potentially send victims to a site of their choice (say a phishing or malware site). 
Internal Redirects can also cause problems if not validated. An attacker may be able to 
bypass authentication or authorization checks.
