HP Fortify Software Security Center Extension Sample : ALM Defect Tracking Integration


-------------
ABOUT
-------------
This sample demonstrates an implementation of the Bug Tracker interface for HP Fortify Software Security Center (SSC).
The interface exists as an extension point to allow end users to customize the integration between SSC
and defect tracking systems.  This allows for users to use the GUI to easily push the found defects into the
an external defect tracking system.

The sample implementation provides an example of how the defect tracking can be performed by delegating the
request to the server, from there the server makes the appropriate calls to the external defect tracking
systems.
